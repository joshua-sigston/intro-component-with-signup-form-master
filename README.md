Did not have figma specs. I used this challenge as an opportunity to learn more about regex and apply it to the application. As far as requirements go, those were completed but added the regex functionality to it. I am sure there is a more effecient or cleaner way to do this, but through research, my JS is the best I could find. If anyone knows of any resources to better implement this, please let me know. I think my JS is a little messy. 

Thank you.
